## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Here I learnt how to make proper use of flex containers, tools and its properties such as justify-content, align-items, flex-direction.
Also learnt about adding Shadow to my main box.

```css
.body-box{
    background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    height: 325px;
    width: 210px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    box-shadow: 0 5px 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```
